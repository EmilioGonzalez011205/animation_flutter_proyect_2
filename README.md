# Rive Animation_Login_Proyect_J.E.G.F.

This project shows (via commits) the step-by-step process for building a login screen animation with responses (of the same) to too many actions or stimuli.

## Previous concepts.

## Features:
The login animation screen has a drawing of a bear that reacts to various stimuli, for example: When we press the email section, the bear directs his gaze to that field, and follows it while we write; if we press the password section, the bear will cover his eyes, in addition the password will be hidden by default, in addition, the field has a button to show the password and hide it again, finally, if one of the fields has an error, the bear will have a reaction of concern, but if both fields are valid, the bear will show a reaction of happiness.

## Rive and State machine.

Rive is an animation design and creation tool that allows you to create interactive animations in real time for any platform.

State machines are a component of River to make animations respond to user input.
