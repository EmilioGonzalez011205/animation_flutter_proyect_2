# Rive Animation_Login_Proyect_J.E.G.F.

This project shows (via commits) the step-by-step process for building a login screen animation with responses (of the same) to too many actions or stimuli.

## Previous concepts.

## Features:
The login animation screen has a drawing of a bear that reacts to various stimuli, for example: When we press the email section, the bear directs his gaze to that field, and follows it while we write; if we press the password section, the bear will cover his eyes, in addition the password will be hidden by default, in addition, the field has a button to show the password and hide it again, finally, if one of the fields has an error, the bear will have a reaction of concern, but if both fields are valid, the bear will show a reaction of happiness.

## Rive and State machine.

Rive is an animation design and creation tool that allows you to create interactive animations in real time for any platform.

State machines are a component of River to make animations respond to user input.


## Technologies
The technologies used for this project are Flutter, an open-source framework from Google for creating cross-platform applications with a single codebase; Visual Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft used to create applications on different platforms and programming languages; Rive, a design and animation tool that allows you to create interactive animations in real time for any platform; State Machines, Rive components to make animations respond to user input; FocusNode, are the points where the foci are located, that is, the focus points; Regex, is the union of regular expression words, is a search engine that finds patterns in the text; Listeners, are objects that wait for and react to events; Controller, are components that handle the logic and communication between components of an application.

## Basic code structure

The code works with two key files in the lib folder, the main which is the folder where the application is basically executed and displayed, and the Loggin_Screen file which is basically where the Login screen that the main displays is built, within this file the logic is built using the technologies seen, the FocusNode are used to focus attention on the email and password fields, state machines are used to turn animations on or off, controllers are used to decide that, listeners to notice changes, etc.
